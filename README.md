# Overview

This is a tutorial on some of the basic data structures used in computer science. This tutorial is designed for those who have a basic understanding of Python and programming concepts. If you are new to programming, you may want to start with a different tutorial. To go through the tutorial, first go to the [welcome](./0-welcome.md) page and then follow the links to get started.

## Content

The tutorial is broken up into three modules, each covering a different structure. Each module contains descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem on your own and you want to check your work.
